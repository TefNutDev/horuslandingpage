                  (i) Multiple farming ops - New pools to generate attractive
                  APRs and farm key tokens of Kava are consistently added. You
                  can not only farm launchpad tokens post launch, new
                  partnerships guarantee a stream of new pools and investment
                  opportunities
                </p>

                  (ii) Fluid Staking - Stake your $KAVA & $HORUS in our native
                  pools with a validator. Generate additional APR while
                  supporting the system`&#39;`s stability.

                  an owner- centric DAO structure â€“ you own $HORUS, so you
                  should also be able to drive key decisions through stake-based
